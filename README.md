# Bananas-Manager
A basic password manager to test my C++ skills after taking a long break from the language. I also created this out of my own desperation for a password manager

## NOTE: I JUST DISCOVERED THAT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE CAN SPACES " " BE USED, WORKING ON BUG FIX

## Feature List
### 1. View Saved Passwords

### 2. Create New Passwords

### 3. Edit Existing Passwords

### 4. Delete Passwords

### 5. Quick 'Export' to txt file


## Objectives For Next Release
### 1. Fix Spaghetti code in "Display.h" and move all of the logic into another class so it can be called there. Just to make it look more readable
### 2. Implement User-Input Checks, currently if the user inputs something that isn't what the program wants or 'out of scope' it will just crash, though to my knowledge this doesn't destroy data
